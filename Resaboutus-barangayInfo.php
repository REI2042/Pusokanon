            <h5 class="fw-bold">HOW DID "PUSOK" GET ITS NAME?</h5>
            <p>
                The Barangay was founded as one of the several settlements in the later part of the 15th century. No one exactly knew the date when Barangay Pusok occupied by inhabitants. The village was occupied by the Tribes of Datu Mangtawnas as their Chief. The tribe settled the northern coastline of what is now Barangay Pusok. In the olden times, no one became the Chief of the tribe if they are not intelligent, wise, smart and BUS-OK meaning, robust, sturdy and physically muscular in structure. And one of them is Datu Mangtawnas. Datu Mangtawnas was known for these characteristics, thus, inhabitant members of the tribe called him BUS-OK. Since then, visitors coming from the different neighboring tribes call him BUSOK. And later on, they pronounce it as PUSOK, and that is how Brgy. Pusok got its name.<br><br>

                Barangay Pusok is bounded by barangay Pajo in the south, and barangay Ibo in the North, barangay Bankal on the East and Mandaue-Mactan Channel on the West. It has a land area of 153.34 hectares with thirteen (13) sitios, namely: Lawis, Mustang (Upper & Lower/seaside), Seabreeze(Ihawan), San Roque (Quitolimbo), Seaside, Sta. Maria, ARCA(Airport Road Community Assâ€™n.), Ibabao, New Lipata, Cemento, Chumba-Chumba, San Miguel(Seawage) and Matumbo (Upper & Lower). The barangay belongs to the average income class of the island-city of Lapu- Lapu it is one of the most progressive and populated among the thirty (30) barangays of the City.<br><br>

                The Barangay had a total population of 26,568 making it 2nd biggest in population of the City. It is a home of 6,710 peace-loving families and a sanctuary of 16,401 registered voters as of May, 2016. Considered as the show-window and gateway of Tourism in the Province of Cebu, the influx of inhabitants from the different provinces and regions of the country began on the year 1979, when Lapu-Lapu City was chosen by then, First Lady Imelda R. Marcos as the ideal place for establishment of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). From then on, the barangay has grown into a Metropolitan area and as host to Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIAA) and the modern bridge, the Marcelo B. Fernan Bridge, it is a strategic springboard for other important and exciting destinations, a place for business opportunities and a perfect haven to live-in.<br><br>
